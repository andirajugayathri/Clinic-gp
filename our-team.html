                        I hail a small town in Calicut(Kerala), where people are shy and old-fashioned and yet my dream
                        was to soar high, and become an airhostess. The only hindrance in my path was my 'gummy smile
                        and short chin' that made me the laughing-stock of my town. With my parents support and the
                        right guidance and treatment from my doctor, I now have the last laugh. I am working for Air
                        India and I am a waiting a call from Emirates Airways.
