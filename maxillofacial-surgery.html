                        <h3>Jaw Asymmetry</h3>
                        <p>Jaw asymmetry is typically caused by misaligned jaws, congenital malformations, malpositioned teeth, intra-uterine trauma, or disproportionate jaw development.
                        A simple check to identify if you have disproportionate jaws would be to check the ratios of your face with respect to the upper part (forehead), middle part (nose) and the lower part (lips and chin). Orthognathic or jaw surgery involves surgical correction of these deformities, thereby adjusting and aligning the bite to make the jaws aesthetically perfect.</p>

                        <p>Temporomandibular joint disorders are a series of complex disorders occurring at the joint that connects the lower jaw to the skull. These are caused by problems and disruption related to the muscle, soft tissue and bone, affecting overall functionality.
                        Severe TMJ disorders increase oro-facial dysfunction and leads to pain and discomfort. Concerns with chewing, clenching of teeth and locking of the jaw joint are some of the discomforts associated. While bite guards and physiotherapy may relieve concerns, in severe cases it requires surgical correction in the joint or a complete joint replacement.</p>

                           Your upper and lower jaw bones along with your teeth provide support to the face, giving it shape and contours that define beauty. Tooth loss, if left untreated, results in gaps that collapse the arch, leading to the deterioration of the supporting bone, further impacting your facial features and the shape of your face. Dental implants directly supported by the bone sustain this gap and act as the root of the tooth, in place of the missed tooth, thus preventing arch collapse and bone resorption.

                           In the course of tooth eruption and jaw bone growth, the teeth may eventually be positioned in an abnormal or atypical alignment. Often, it is this atypical alignment that makes a tooth susceptible to damage by caries or ‘trauma from occlusion,’ which eventually leads to it needing to be extracted. These teeth often need surgical extraction, where a surgical procedure may be needed to be carried out on the bone and gums for extraction. A wide range of variables come into play depending on the complexity, and a dentist may not be able to handle the same. A maxillofacial surgeon comes with specialized expertise in pain management and surgical skills, well-suited for this procedure.

                            There can be many factors that may lead to a TMJ disorder and cannot be pointed to a single one. Some of the common causes are an abnormal bite caused due to tooth loss, often leading to asymmetric chewing, poor neck and face posture, jaw injuries, bruxism or jaw clenching (especially at night), joint erosion, and genetic reasons. In periods of stress, your TMJ disorders may be exacerbated with heightened teeth grinding and clenching, resulting in increased levels of pain.

                            Cleft lip is a birth defect that affects a child’s ability to feed, breathe, and speak normally and also restricts the child from having a natural full smile. Reconstructive cleft lip surgery is usually performed in children within 6 months of birth and is a safe procedure. This would repair the functionality of the lip defect. If the child requires a cleft palate surgery, this is also planned around the time the child begins the process of learning to talk, and along with regular speech therapy, we ensure the child is normally assimilated into society as a beautiful person. Depending on the severity of the deformity, our pediatric surgeon would guide you through the treatment and procedure undertaken.
